(CNN)US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday drew firm distinctions between the United States and Russia as he sought to make the case that the US is the better partner for countries in Africa.

In a speech about the Biden administration's "strategy for Sub-Saharan Africa," delivered in Pretoria, South Africa, the top US diplomat argued that "the United States and African nations can't achieve any of our shared priorities -- whether that's recovering from the pandemic, creating broad-based economic opportunities, addressing the climate crisis, expanding energy access, revitalizing democracies, or strengthening the free and open international order -- we can't do any of that if we don't work together as equal partners."
"Our strategy is rooted in the recognition that Sub-Saharan Africa is a major geopolitical force -- one that shaped our past, is shaping our present, and will shape our future," Blinken said.
Blinken's visit to the continent -- with stops in South Africa, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and Rwanda -- and pitch for US partnership there comes as Moscow has sought to step up its influence in Africa amid isolation from Europe over its war in Ukraine. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov traveled to Ethiopia, Uganda, the Republic of Congo, and Egypt at the end of July.
